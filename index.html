  <h1>TANNER</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <br>
  
  <p class="text-space">I currently work in the field of healthcare in the prehospital setting, while attending the University of Phoenix for a BS in Computer Sceince.
  This will slowly change overtime, as this will become a showcase of my personal achievments and projects.
  I started this adventure into the tech space back in Janurary of 2021, initally enrolling into an cyber security degree, as that is what peaked my interest. As time moved forward though, I found web dev and programming to be amazing.
